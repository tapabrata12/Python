        "2. **Execution Flow**: The outer condition is evaluated first. If it is `True`, the inner condition(s) are checked. If any of the conditions fail, the program may jump to an `else` or `elif` block.\n",
        "3. **Readability**: Deeply nested conditions can become hard to read. It's good practice to limit nesting or refactor code for clarity.\n",

        "In Python for handling conditions we have one more concept called **Match and case statement** (Specially in C language we called it switch statement).\n",
        "\n",
        "The `match` statement in Python is used for pattern matching, allowing you to compare a value against a set of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches. Here are the key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pattern Matching**: `match` allows for matching a value against multiple patterns, similar to switch-case in other languages but more powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syntax**: Starts with the `match` keyword followed by the value to match, then uses `case` clauses to define patterns and corresponding actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Patterns**: Patterns can be literals, sequences, mappings, class instances, and more, providing a flexible way to specify conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Guards**: `case` clauses can include guard expressions with an `if` condition to further refine when a match is successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use Cases**: Useful for complex data deconstruction, handling different data types, and more readable and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This feature was introduced in Python 3.10.\n",
